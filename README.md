# msbuild-intelligent-query-demo

## TODOS
1. Swap out direct tools calls with an MCP server
2. Replace the streamlit GUI with a simple ASP.NET front end or possibly react. 

## DONE
1. Get rid of google collab specific code blocks. 
2. Streamline notebook code blocks. Got rid of "raw" index. Data ingestion may be too slow to run live. 
3. Revise all of the markdown blocks to align with streamlined flow.
4. Swap out Google Maps search with Microsoft Maps search
5. Trimmed and localized the demo data set in properties.jsonl file. New data set has 10K records.
