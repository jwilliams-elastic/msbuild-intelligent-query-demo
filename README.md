# msbuild-intelligent-query-demo

## TODOS
1. Swap out direct tools calls with an MCP server
2. Replace the streamlit GUI with a simple ASP.NET front end or possibly react. 

## DONE
1. Get rid of google collab specific code blocks. 
2. Streamline notebook code blocks. Got rid of "raw" index. Data ingestion is still too slow to run this code block live. 
3. Added a max_docs setting in case we want to show data ingestion live with a partial dataset. (need to figure out if it's worth trouble or just too risky)
4. Revise all of the markdown blocks to align with streamlined flow.
5. Swap out Google Maps search with Microsoft Maps search
